# Leetcode Challenges w/ explanations.

### 1. Find an Euclidian distance between (2, 3) and (10, 8). 
Function takes four parameters, one for each x and y point (2 dimentions). Take the square root of (x2 - x1) ^ 2 and add it to y axies. 

### 2. Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number.
Check if n is less than zero to remove negative intergers. 
Get square root of n, check if n equals square ** 2.

### 3. Summation
Set sum to zero. For loop that starts at 1 and goes to num (parameter) + 1. Add each iteration to sum. Return.

### 4. Regex Validate PIN Code
ATM machines allow 4 or 6 digit PIN codes and PIN codes cannot contain anything but exactly 4 digits or exactly 6 digits.
