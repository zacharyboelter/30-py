# This is where I will be deocumenting and completing Leetcode challenges and writing markdown with explanations for said problem sets.

### 1. Find an Euclidian distance between (2, 3) and (10, 8). 
Function takes four parameters, one for each x and y point (2 dimentions). Take the square root of (x2 - x1) ^ 2 and add it to y axies. 

### 2. Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number.
Check if n is less than zero to remove negative intergers. 
Get square root of n, check if n equals square ** 2.
